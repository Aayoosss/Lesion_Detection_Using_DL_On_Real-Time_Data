Dental  lesion  detection  in  medical  imaging  remains  a  critical challenge  in  diagnostic  dentistry.  This  research  leverages  a  deep learning-based  detection  approach  for  early-stage  lesion  identification.  A custom-curated data set comprising both high-quality healthy and periapical lesion-based  and  DenseNet121.  Extensive  experiments, including  5-fold  cross-validation  and  independent  test  evaluations, demonstrate  DenseNet121  achieving  the  highest  accuracy  at  95.83%, followed  by  InceptionV3  and  ALexNet.  The challenges addressed include class imbalance and data set variations, while insights from comparative model performance highlight DenseNet121 as optimal for robust lesion detection. The results emphasize the transformative potential of AI in improving diagnostic accuracy and accessibility, setting the foundation for advanced dental imaging applications using deep learning.
